A voxel engine prototype built in **Unity** using a hybrid **C# and C++ architecture**. The project demonstrates integration between Unity and a native DLL for voxel-related processing.

---

## 📖 Overview

Unity Voxel Engine v2 is an experimental voxel engine that separates responsibilities between Unity scripts and native C++ code. Unity handles project structure, scripting, and engine integration, while performance-sensitive logic is implemented in a compiled native library.

This repository serves as a technical demonstration of Unity-to-native code interoperability and voxel engine experimentation.

---

## 📋 Current Features

- Unity project configured for voxel engine development  
- Native **C++ DLL integration** (`VoxelEngine_v2.dll`)  
- Supporting C++ source project included  
- Organized Unity project structure  
- Functional foundation for voxel engine experimentation

## 📊 Architecture

### Unity (C#)

Responsible for:

- Engine integration  
- Project management  
- Script execution  
- Communication with the native DLL
- Chunk **mesh** generation 

### Native Library (C++)

Responsible for:

- Voxel-related processing implemented outside of Unity  
- Performance-focused logic compiled into a DLL
- Chunk **noise** generation

Unity scripts interface with the native library to execute voxel processing tasks.

---

## 🤔 Requirements

- Unity (Version compatible with project settings)  
- Visual Studio or another C# development environment  
- Visual Studio with C++ workload (if modifying the native project)  

---

## 💻 Setup

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BloodyFish/UnityVoxelEngine_v2.git
```

### Open Project

1. Open **Unity Hub**  
2. Click **Add Project**  
3. Select the cloned folder  
4. Open the project  

---

## 📚 Native DLL

The project includes a prebuilt native library:

```
VoxelEngine_v2.dll
```

If you modify the C++ source project, rebuild the DLL and replace the existing file inside the Unity project directory.

---

## 🔬 Purpose of the Project

This project is intended as:

- A voxel engine for Unity  
- A demonstration of Unity and native C++ interoperability  
- A foundation for voxel based games
